  <li><b>managed to sort out differentiation between removing from lib while browsing post index and removing from lib while in lib. Both need to redirect to different places. When removing from lib you need to be redirected to your lib index, when browsing and removing you need to be redirected to the index of all posts. Done!</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>To do</h2>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>need to differentiate between removing from library from the lib, and from the post list. they need to redirect to different places</b></li>
  <li>double check the library stuff when posts are made to see if they can be stored etc.</li>
  <li>sort out the codepen embeds so the same things isn't hardcoded onto every post show page</li>
</ul>

<h3>Low Priority</h3>
<ul>
  <li>put in an added to library message when the users adds a post to their lib</li>
  <li>sort out the nav mess in the layout erb</li>
  <li>get the codepen to embed properly</li>
  <li>get an image from the codepen to save in the :image column for each post</li>
  <li>display posts in a sexy grid</li>
  <li>make it so admin user list links to individual profile rather than just seeing their own profile for every user</li>
  <li>get a search function going for site content</li>
  <li>give admin power to see post list and delete any inappropriate one, e.g. CSS penis</li>
</ul>
