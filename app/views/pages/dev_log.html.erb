<u><h1>Development Log</h1></u>

<h2>BUGS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>when editing an image, the url value doesn't stay in the form (when updating)</li>
  <li>thought this was a bug, but it turns out to be a benefit</li>
  <li>the way it's set up means that if there is an image url, it will show that, if not it will show the uploaded image (as the user will only be doing one kind)</li>
  <li>this means that if the user gave a url initially and they edit to upload one, the url is removed, so there cannot be 2 images in the system at the same time</li>
  <li>if the url did remain there then it would override the uploaded image</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixes Needed:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make post display pages into partials where possible</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>User Stuff</h3>
<ul>
  <li>present error messages when user is an idiot</li>

</ul>

<h3>Post Stuff</h3>
<ul>
  <li>posting system works for adding and reading a post, as well as listing on the index page</li>
  <li>make a link for a new post for users that are signed in (you can view posts without an account, but need one to post and have a lib)</li>
  <li>post is given a user_id upon creation, relating it to the author of the post</li>
  <li>translated the author id into a name</li>
  <li>need to be able to update/edit and delete posts</li>
  <li>crUD system for posts, only author can edit/delete their own post</li>

  <li>author links to author's profile page, showing their other posts</li>
  <li>posts you have made don't show on your own profile, as they are in your library</li>
</ul>

<h3>Library stuff</h3>
<ul>
  <li>figured out how to give a user a library object automatically when they sign up (so they can view it and add to it)</li>
  <li>new posts are automatically added to the author's library</li>
  <li>make a view library page specific to the current user</li>
  <li>add to library function</li>
  <li>hide the add library option if the current user already has it in their library</li>
  <li>replaced the add to lib with a remove from library function for the current user if it's already in there</li>
  <li>added a like/pin/add to library link on every post only if user is logged in</li>
  <li><b>managed to sort out differentiation between removing from lib while browsing post index and removing from lib while in lib. Both need to redirect to different places. When removing from lib you need to be redirected to your lib index, when browsing and removing you need to be redirected to the index of all posts. Done!</b></li>
  <li>made it so users can only edit/delete their posts from their libraries</li>
  <li>split library into my posts and favourite posts</li>

  <li>tidy up what shows and hides depending on the presence of content/information (i.e. if there's no description, hide it, or just require them all)</li>
  <li>mess around with codepen embed to make it better, but keep it working</li>
  <li>try and break shit and fix if necessary</li>

  <li>there should just be a sign in bit, and a differentiation between image and code posts on the nav</li>
  <li>when the user is signed in it should have a pic of them and their name, which when clicked on will reveal a dropdown menu</li>
  <li>navbar should be fixed</li>
</ul>
